## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Common Sense & Google

### What I learned

I've learned a lot from searching for solution, but most from the comments on other solutions.

It helped to first analyze the image and plan steps:
Step 1: Color background
Step 2 Create a div for the card and center it horizontal and vertical, rounded corners and padding
Step 3: Insert image with rounded corners
Step 4: Add two paragraphs, font

### Continued development

I need to learn a lot of basic CSS still. And these standard practices like CSS reset.
